##The site is now live!

After tinkering around with Jekyll-Bootstrap locally for a while, I have finally commited it to Github and therefore the outside world. Now that I have a link I can actually send people to, it will keep me motivated on making progress on the project.

In the time being, my friend [Talon Daniels](https://github.com/Talon876) and I are expirementing with pull requests for site management. We'll see how the workflow goes!
