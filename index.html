AndroidRover.org is currently under construction while I attend Robogames 2013<p>
If you are interested in the source code, head over to the Github repo here: <a href="https://github.com/Legomaniac/AndroidRover">gitbub.com/Legomaniac/AndroidRover</a>
Come back after May 3rd and there should be stuff going on here!<p>
